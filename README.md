# btaylor.io - a resume

## Setup

Clone the repository on your machine.

Make sure you have npm installed, then run:


```bash
npm install
```

## Running

To run the webpage, we have a few options:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start -p 8000"
  },
}
```

`npm dev` deploys the app on the default next.js port of `3000`

`npm build` builds the app

`npm start` deploys the app on the port `8000`
